###### Aesthetics, web folklore  
The aesthetics of the early web result from a combination of experimentation, freedom and self-expression. The early web was in motion, full of textures, expanding the crafty practices we knew.

###### Words, meaning, intention  
As stated in the beginning of this article, words bear meaning, making the process of choosing words an ongoing display of intention. What do I want to say, convey, share? The answer to those questions is the resulting intention. That very same intention then gets put into action; this is where we reconnect to crafting, and the web.

###### The wIzArd of oz  
Now, a note on this statement.  
For Christmas 2023, I went to the cinema with my brother and father to watch the new Wicked movie. I enjoyed it.  
For Christmas 2024, we went back together to the cinema, to watch the second and last part of that Wicked movie. I got an epiphany moment from it.  
  
*Are you all familiar with the story of the Wizard of Oz and the Wicked Witch?*  
  
|NOOOO|  
Elphaba discovers the treachery on which the land of Oz is built and tries to rebel and call it out. She is from then on called the Wicked Witch of the West. Her fight is of the utmost importance, and in the process of it, I realised that this treachery is very similar to the one of Generative AI: a smokescreen, trying to make a carefully wired illusion pass for the truth, for magic, as if nothing had consequences.  
  
|YEEEEY|  
Elphaba discovers the treachery on which the land of Oz is built: the wizards does not have magic and everything he does is machinery and illusions – more like a stage magician. She tries to rebel and call it out. She is from then on called the Wicked Witch of the West. Her fight is of the utmost importance, and in the process of it, I realised that this treachery is very similar to the one of Generative AI: a smokescreen, trying to make a carefully wired illusion pass for the truth, for magic, as if nothing had consequences.  
  
Our fights connect:  
We fight against a system, we fight for singularity and against discrimination, we fight a well-oiled machine but there is a chance it will simply betray himself, lost in its own lies.  
We share the same intentions and combat, simply the location differs.  
  
From that realisation, I made up the Wicked Witch of the World Wide Web.  
  
###### Magic and play and web and craft (CIRCLE)  
Magic has this mystery, this way of appealing to our curiosity that makes us want to play, to experiment with it. Referring again to Huizinga,   
<blockquote>“just as there is no formal difference between play and ritual, so the ‘consecrated spot’ cannot be formally distinguished from the play-ground. The arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice, etc., are all in form and function play-grounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain.”   
<br>(Huizinga, J. (1964) Homo Ludens: A study of the play element in culture. Boston, USA: The Beacon Press, p. 10). </blockquote>  
Here he uses something interesting, connecting magic circles, stages and screens as play-grounds. With such a connection, we end up with an allegory for every theme covered here: magic circles represent magic and physical gatherings; stages are where action takes place, and simultaneously the illusion served by seamlessness; screens represent the web, the digital.   
And the snake is back to eating its tail. The Ouroboros has been invoked. We are now back to the web and the curiosity triggered by magic leads us into its craftiness, through experimentation

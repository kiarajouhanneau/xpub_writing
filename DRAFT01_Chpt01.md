  Investigation into web making as a craft, the importance of the gesture and the role of intention when making, creating.
  Here I will take inspiration from various artists and web practitioners, as well as in my own practice. I will seek to demonstrate my intuition: creating relies on intention, intention is then embodied and this gesture shapes the craft. This interrelation should also be true when creating for the web.

## 1. Incantations and spells  
#### 1.1 net.art   
From the beginning of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, its inventor, viewed it as a way of connecting all the people of the world together and a great opportunity to expand creativity and imagination (Berners-Lee, T. (2025) This is for everyone. Macmillan, London).    
This idea took on quite rapidly, with the first net.artists[^1] rising as early as 1994 (the web itself was created in 1989 and open to the public in 1993!)    
Net.artists saw the potential of hyperlinks and inter-connectivity to create, the most active practitioner being Olia Lialina. On artsy.net we can read:   
>“In 1996, her browser-based piece My Boyfriend Came Back From The War made her a notable pioneer of internet art. Her click-to-reveal storyline about reunited lovers was built on HTML frames, a newly-released feature that let developers put multiple pages in one browser. She wasn’t just translating a story onto the internet, she was telling a story in the language of the web browser”[^2].

%% IMG: My Boyfriend Came Back From The War + Summer %%  
  
*Telling a story with the language of the web* – this is beautiful and very à propos as web poetry might/will be mentioned.    
Later, in 2013, Lialina built *Summer*[^3], a webring working across 26 websites, based on an animated GIF of a woman on a swing. The GIF was split in still images and the webring connects every image to the following – creating the animation – by having every website included hosting one image. This ring is particularly interesting for the fact that it plays by itself, it doesn’t need a single click to operate, only network connection and maintenance from the web makers.    
In 2011, when HTML5 launched and eliminated frame elements, Lialina told Creators’ Kathleen Flood that   
> “Many of my works were based on features that browser developers considered being bugs and were removing those bugs in newer versions, so, I have to find new tricks to keep them alive.”  
  
I believe this is a perfect definition of crafting; inflating life into ideas with the means at our disposal, adapt to change to maintain the unexpected, hack – in the sense of using inappropriate or unexpected means to create or perform an action.    
This notion of ‘unexpected’ is also important for the core of craft, I believe, is intention. A creator of any kind is not simply one that has an idea; turning that idea into reality requires the intention to act, in other words, to link the mind and the body together. An that is how the creator might conjure the unexpected: that intention of creation sparks from an idea, so it bears a certain shape (the sharpness of it not being important) and in the process of creation this creator might reach or give life to shapes that were not pictured, that were not expected. Sometimes, the unexpected reveals itself more interesting, inspiring, etc. than the original picture of the creator’s mind. That is when they will decide to nurture it. This is what Olia Lialina is explaining above.  
  
Crafting makes a lot of sense when speaking of website making for it is a form of expression, and as explained above, an art form. In her book Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound (University of Minnesota Press 2014), Lori Emerson refers to crafting as experimentation:   
>“Learning through doing, tinkering, experimentation, trial-and-error is, then, how one comes to have a genuine computer literacy.”  
  
This makes me reach the following conclusion: even the most stereotypical developer, having done their curriculum in programming, maths and engineering is making art, in the sense that they are writing, and the trial-and-error, drafting process is very similar to the one of art. On that note, it is more and more common to see these developers host Twitch live streams, thus becoming also content creators, performers, tutors.  
  
Though it may seem to be a completely unrelated discipline, magic is also full of crafting. From the most obvious love potion to the most mystical meditation, every practice involves the body (often one of a channelling person, usually the “magic” person (e.g. fortune teller)) and sometimes even some specific gestures to reproduce or enhance the power of intention.    
In my mind, magic is a process: an intuition becomes intention, that intention is being realised through whatever physical means we like. The whole process involves, requires a connection and listening to our own emotions and feelings, to acknowledge what is within ourselves as much as what lies in our surroundings.   
  
Now that this has been laid down, we can dive deeper. I asked myself, what is the glue that keeps politics, language, playfulness, the web and that touch of magic together, the answer is purpose.

#### 1.2 Building, sharing, caring  
My personal view of magic is ruled by intention, intention is what will make one say certain words, act a certain way. That same intention should be, I believe, at the core of website making. That same intention injects politics in things. As mentioned above, magic is a process and this process can be applied to any aspect of our lives. Here I am focusing on web crafting, so I will develop my argument accordingly.     
Crafting a website starts with a spark, an idea let’s say. Then, we act upon it to give life to that website. Every choice along the way is ruled by intention(s) and intuition(s). However, what differentiates web crafting from built-in drag-and-drop WYSIWYG[^4] website makers is attention. Attention to detail, to the public/audience, to the website itself. This is what Raphaël Bastide depicts in his performative piece being a script.     
> Before the first line in the diary of my existence, I am nothing. In fact, I am an intention, an empty document, but the air is full of me, I am there in a form that is vaporous, sweet, and naive. I will do everything, sort everything, as if by miracle, I am a formula, an appeal to the divine. Before everything begins, I wait for hands.    
> (Bastide, R. (2025) being a script. Available at: https://raphaelbastide.com/etre-script (Accessed: 22 October 2025).)  
  
In a conversation[^5] we had together, Raphaël told me about the creation process of this piece. How he started writing it during the first months of his newborn daughter, the role and place taken by the body and physical gestures in this process. He also told me about the questions at the heart of this creation:   
- a slow lack of interest for technicality that drives choices leaning towards a more human, emotional approach;   
- (how) can we operate a shift from machine learning technologies that deprive us from our creative capacities?;   
- a choice to put himself in the public/audience’s shoes in order to let go, to enact a discovery of his own work and evaluate its emotional reach.  
Those questions are all at least partly answered by the notion of caring. The moment we decide to build a web project, whether it be an entire website or a single page, we perform an act of care. We care for the project, for what it bears, for the web commons and the people that will interact with our creation. being a script is an ode to code, because to some extent, we also care for the code. This caring is quite particular, one might care for the code as a mode of expression, or as the bone of the project, or even in order for it to be readable and reusable by peers.    
Once we have built and that we have chosen to (take) care (for), we share. Sharing is beyond the creator, it is an agreement with the medium. The web is like a antique forum, the central place of the city, where people share all sorts of ideas. Web forums take their name from it. Sharing is inherent to the web, as it is using the Internet, connecting multiple computers (servers) and people together. And just as any art form, web crafting and net.art are created with a sharing intention. It can be to share the piece itself as a whole, the technique or medium, or something more abstract or personal, like a message, an idea, a world.  
  
This is what creators such as Doriane Timmermans, Daniel Murray and Roos Groothuizen do.

#### 1.3 Webrings and digital gardens: where the web becomes *magical*   
Back in its first years of life, the web did not have such “powerful” search engines and discovering new websites was more of a treasure hunt. To compensate for this lacking, web-makers created webrings: a script file was put in the code folder, containing a list of all members and a looping function, interlinking members to one another. Those early webring were thematic: gardeners, fandoms, cooking websites, etc. It allowed visitors to discover other people having the same passions or interests. <!--- IMG: webrings examples --->    
For a few years now, webrings are showing up again, regaining popularity. Of course not for the reason, but they still act as a very good discovery/connecting tool. This revival is linked to a movement of revolt, a common voice rising from the depths of the web: the indie web. It is a practice born from a desire of reclaiming the web space, taken over by big corporations (GAFAM[^6]). It relies on principles such as hand-written code, low-weight websites, F/LOSS[^7] and sharing.[^8] It advocates for personal websites as a form of expression, opposite to corporate-owned social media platforms, for they invite us to care about what we share and how.    
Another form of social webcraft is digital gardens. Maggie Appleton describes them:  
> They’re not following the conventions of the “personal blog”, as we’ve come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.    
> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren’t strictly organised by their publication date. They’re inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren’t refined or complete – notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They’re less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we’re used to seeing.[^9]  
  
A digital garden is like a notebook, shared for other people to flip through.     
Here, we touch something interesting: one practice is very close to the one of clubs as in a book club, people gathering *around* a shared passion; the other takes gardening, an activity highly *centred* on care and patience, as a metaphor for its form.     
— But, Kiara, why is this interesting exactly?    
Well, it is quite simple really: both webrings and digital gardens rely on physical practices – linked to the senses –, transposed to the web. Almost as if the presence of the body was unconsciously needed by everyone online… ;)    
Additionally, both are seen as “magical” or enchanting, creating a feeling of amazement for they seem to pertain to an outside world and tend to be poetical or…playful!    
We can pull on that rope and reach analogies to magic craft itself – here referring to practices pertaining to ritual and spell casting.    
Webrings mirror magic circles: both use the circle shape and its attributes of constant sharing and flow, thus serving as ways of gathering and performing (magic circles perform a ritual, webrings perform a community).    
Digital gardens mirror books of spells and potions: collections of writings and experimentations that can be passed on and modified through time, acting as recipes, guides and heritage.    
In that sense, they are completely made by and for (a) community.    
To my knowledge, the most extensive depiction of that statement is what Daniel Murray, a.k.a melonking, built. Starting to build his own corner of the web in 2016, he now gathers hundreds of people on ‘MelonLand‘. His digital world includes his website, a forum, multiple webrings, a wiki, and more. In a interview he gave to Kendal Beynon he describes the ‘Everyone Site’, a feature of MelonLand:  
> This came out of a workshop that I did in Brussels with Doriane Timmermans[^10]. At the workshop, we were doing experiments through the open-source online editor Etherpad. I was working with Karl Moubarak[^11] from the collective Hackers and Designers[^12]. He came up with this system where we could write JavaScript in the Etherpad and it would inject the JavaScript directly into a browser extension, which meant that you could basically collectively write code that could morph how people's browsers worked. It was a complete security nightmare, but I thought that was a really exciting idea. The Everyone Site (eSite) is essentially that idea of collective programming applied to a web server and moderated by the forums community.

#### Notes  
  
[^1]: net.art refers to a group of artists who have worked in the medium of Internet art since 1994. […] <br>The term "net.art" is also used as a synonym for net art or Internet art and covers a much wider range of artistic practices. In this wider definition, net.art means art that uses the Internet as its medium and that cannot be experienced in any other way. Typically net.art has the Internet and the specific socio-culture that it spawned as its subject matter but this is not required.<br>The German critic Tilman Baumgärtel - building on the ideas of American critic Clement Greenberg - has frequently argued for a "media specificity" of net.art in his writings. According to the introduction to his book "net.art. Materialien zur Netzkunst", the specific qualities of net.art are "connectivity, global reach, multimediality, immateriality, interactivity and egality". (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net.art)

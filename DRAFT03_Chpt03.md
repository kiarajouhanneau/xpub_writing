## 3. Reclaiming: a fight for our future  
#### 3.1 Fun against totalitarianism   
The state of the web is currently unstable, taken over by big Silicon Valley corporation, pushing AI slop in everything, until we all become numb. In her article *From the Philosophy of the Open to the Ideology of the User-Friendly*, Lori Emerson explains how computers used to be accessible to their users, offering the possibility to become hardware-savvy, and how through time, they become less and less operable and changeable, thus turning into mysterious black boxes that we expect to just work. This system is creating a great seamlessness, valuing templates and drag-and-drop website makers instead of the craft of HTML and CSS. That is how we loose singularity and get lost in a virtual sea of grid-ruled websites.   
In addition, we’re always compelled and pushed to find purpose, to have a reason, a use for everything we say and make. That’s the principle of design; art with an applied function. That is terribly sad. It always made me feel like an outcast, because sometimes it is very nice to do things because we appreciate them or because they ‘feel right’. So let’s embrace the useless, for the sake of fun.   
As Johan Huizinga demonstrates in his book Homo Ludens (Huizinga, J. (1964) Homo Ludens: A study of the play element in culture. Boston, USA: The Beacon Press), play is an inherent part of life and losing playfulness gives way to seriousness, leading to extreme political situations. Meaning that in order to fight those political crises, we need to embrace playfulness.  
  
Language is one of the pillars of politics: how do you address people, diction and tone, choice of words and topics… and convincing, gaining voters. Games share the spotlight, but more insidiously: looking at Johan Huizinga’s *Homo Ludens*, he draws a tight connection between the mechanics of playing and those of contesting: “The agon in Greek life, or the contest anywhere else in the world, bears all the formal characteristics of play, and as to its function belongs almost wholly to the sphere of the festival, which is the playsphere. It is quite impossible to separate the contest as a cultural function from the complex ‘play-festival-rite’.” ([Huizinga, 1964, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/C54R2GCV)). The political sphere has rules, contestants (players), winners, losers, just like a typical card game.  
  
**Quotes from Katika Kühnreich at 39C3**  
“So, first in my own words: Fascism promises you to go back to a past that never existed. And they tell you it will be grand.  
Fascism provides you with a community that is paid for by the blood of others. Because the only community fascism knows is “we are better than them”.”  
“And please, I really get mad if people say "Fascism is a reaction to feminism, queers, or whatsoever."  
No! Fascism is a collectivity of people who rule over others by force. Thank you. They have fragile masculinity, and there's therapy for that.  For their own gain of power, they treat others badly and build concentration camps. And they tell masses stories. They will lure them into their kind of poisoned community.”  
“Fascism does not appear because of feminism or "the left". Fascism appears because it's financed. (applause)  
And fascism doesn't disappear because you ignore it. People tried that.  
And, especially important, you shouldn't hand some microphones to fascists. (applause) That's what they want. You do not give them platforms. And the best thing is, do not go onto their platforms either. (applause) Fascism only disappears when it's opposed, not ignored. (applause) So please, oppose it with every possible mean. Because there's not the one good measure. We do not have to fight about measures. We have to fight against fascism.”  
“We can disconnect from fascist infrastructures and nuts. We can break the hyper-connection and form local connections from neighbourhoods, from collective spaces.”  
“And have fun doing it. This is a duty you can do with others. There is no rule that anti-fascism can't be danced.”  
“Let's pack, put the fun back into anti-fascism, and create a good world.”

#### 3.2 Cyberpunk: aesthetics vs ideology  
  
**Quotes from Katika Kühnreich at 39C3**  
“Stories can help us, give us guidelines, hope. Can make us believe that if we follow that story's rules, everything will be easy. But we have to be careful what kind of stories we believe in.  
Because fascism is a story.  
And sometimes it's very well told. And cybernetics is a story as well. A mechanical fairy tale.”  
“And something else happened in the late 19th, at the beginning of the 20th century. The discovery of masses.  
To see, like, the majority of people not as something that should just be ruled, but to be integrated either by education or by propaganda. And how to influence these masses would be the goal of many beliefs.  
So, there was one thing that helped a lot. That was technology, newspapers, radio. And there was a fascinating young movement, trying out new ways, combining tactics from different social movements and art. Sounds great, doesn't it? And some of the slogans could have been "Disrupt!", "Love technology!", "Welcome the future!", and "Embrace futurism!".”  
“So, they gave us a huge thing to swallow with that cybernetics, future thingy. And then they gave us an even bigger thing to swallow. And because we were well-trained and fascinated, we didn't even choke. So, they gave us "AI", artificial intelligence. It's so wow, isn't it?  
No, it isn't. You shouldn't say "whoa" when someone gives you a good word. You should say "Why?" or "What?", "What do you mean?". So, what is "AI"? And why is the lady always using quotes on that? Well, the lady is using quotes on that because the lady doesn't like the term and thinks it's bullshit.   
Artificial intelligence is nothing more than a sales argument. It's a money-spending idea of "money-shitterly", as they say in some areas of Germany.”  
“So, in short, cybernetics went into arts and science fiction and they invented stuff and said "it will be great in the future". But maybe we should really think about stories we believe in. We shouldn't ignore so many facts. AI is using huge amounts of energy, water, and human lives. And they gave us that story that AI will solve the climate crisis. And this is like trying to extinguish a fire with diesel. You can try it.  
So, please, be an adult, like stories, but do not confuse them with reality and be an adult, break something to make it stop.”  
“So, what if..., what if ..., what  
if you ..., what if you combine fascism with modern digital technology and hyper-connectivity? What would happen? Let us imagine. Well, look at that.  
Someone showing a Hitler salute on a huge American stage. That is so amazing. Who would have thought 10 years ago that would be happening? Isn't that great, the times we live in? Isn't that great? And the best thing is, this guy got access to so many, so many data. And data is power, by the way.”

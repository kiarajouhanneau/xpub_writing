## 3. Reclaiming: a fight for our future  
#### 3.1 Fun against totalitarianism   
The state of the web is currently unstable, taken over by big Silicon Valley corporation, pushing AI slop in everything, until we all become numb. In her article *From the Philosophy of the Open to the Ideology of the User-Friendly*, Lori Emerson explains how computers used to be accessible to their users, offering the possibility to become hardware-savvy, and how through time, they become less and less operable and changeable, thus turning into mysterious black boxes that we expect to just work. This system is creating a great seamlessness, valuing templates and drag-and-drop website makers instead of the craft of HTML and CSS. That is how we loose singularity and get lost in a virtual sea of grid-ruled websites.   
In addition, we’re always compelled and pushed to find purpose, to have a reason, a use for everything we say and make. That’s the principle of design; art with an applied function. That is terribly sad. It always made me feel like an outcast, because sometimes it is very nice to do things because we appreciate them or because they ‘feel right’. So let’s embrace the useless, for the sake of fun.   
As Johan Huizinga demonstrates in his book Homo Ludens (Huizinga, J. (1964) Homo Ludens: A study of the play element in culture. Boston, USA: The Beacon Press), play is an inherent part of life and losing playfulness gives way to seriousness, leading to extreme political situations. Meaning that in order to fight those political crises, we need to embrace playfulness.  
  
Language is one of the pillars of politics: how do you address people, diction and tone, choice of words and topics… and convincing, gaining voters. Games share the spotlight, but more insidiously: looking at Johan Huizinga’s *Homo Ludens*, he draws a tight connection between the mechanics of playing and those of contesting: “The agon in Greek life, or the contest anywhere else in the world, bears all the formal characteristics of play, and as to its function belongs almost wholly to the sphere of the festival, which is the playsphere. It is quite impossible to separate the contest as a cultural function from the complex ‘play-festival-rite’.” ([Huizinga, 1964, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/C54R2GCV)). The political sphere has rules, contestants (players), winners, losers, just like a typical card game.

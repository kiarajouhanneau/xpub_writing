It all started with a hunch: the web bears magic. Many have questioned the relevance of that word in that context, and I am not entirely sure myself that “magic” is appropriate. But so far, it has been fine to go along with it.  
To investigate that hunch, I had to go back into my personal practice and uncover a truth I’ve always been aware of, but that finally found its meaning. In every project that I built and am building, 3 common aspects are always there: politics, language and playfulness. They are always intertwined and communicating, in one way or another. Let me illustrate some examples:  
1. *Rêves Party*[^2], my first single-source publishing[^6] project, a collection of texts,connected through dream, travel, time.  
2. *Synthetica*[^3], a work in progress, gathering writings about Generative AI (GenAI) and visual arts.  
3. *Thinking about the immortality of the crab*[^4], one of my latest zines, made during Special Issue 27: See you many times (XPUB Rotterdam, 2025).

| Rêves Party                                | - born as a response to COVID lock-down measures in France, closing all cultural places to visitors<br>- attention in curating only texts pertaining to french literature                                      | - research topic associated to that project: How is the word (as a main language component) used for playing and experimenting purposes?<br>- words are central and highlighted through carefully imagined animations and interactions. | idem (merged)<br>- the website is white text on a black screen, the printed booklet is black ink on white paper<br>- every print is different, CSS-print allowing the continuing of browser animations until one hits “print (ctrl/cmp+p)”        |  
| Synthetica                                 | - GenAI is more an ideology than a proper technology (as explained by Khrys, a french tech researcher)[^1] <br>- the curation of texts is based on texts highlighting the dangers and downsides of those tools | - again central, the whole book revolves around a thematic index of precisely chosen terms                                                                                                                                              | - in the construction of the book itself, inspired by “Choose your own adventure” books, allowing readers to jump from text to text through the index itself<br>- it mimics the visual identity of Wikipedia, showing indexed words as hyperlinks |  
| Thinking about the immortality of the crab | - it is about time and how it is a social construct, with some reflections and personal opinions on society related to time                                                                                    | - the titles used for the different sections reference subtly the topic <br>- some reflections on time-based expressions and idioms                                                                                                     | - also in those titles, since most of them are puns or references to pop culture<br>- in the use of the Spanish idiom used as the main title of the zine                                                                                          |

Once I laid this truth about my work, I knew my research would revolve around politics, language and playfulness. Let me explain further their relevance to my initial hunch about the web’s connection to magic.  
1. Both the web and magic are political  
	1. The web is a space for expression and expression is political as it carries opinions, moreover it has also become a preferred space and tool for political parties to advertise, gain voters and campaign[^5].   
	2. A great part of magic history is about fighting repression; think of witches hunts, and more globalised discrimination associating women, people of colour, redheads, and many more to evil magic or curse-bound. I personally picture magic as a huge reclaiming force.  
2. Both the web and magic rely on language  
	1. The web is built by language as in programming languages, but also for all it bears; forums, blogs, etc., a lot of web spaces revolve around writing, therefore language.   
	2. Magic, in most of its crafted forms, is also built and relying on language: runes, spells, potions, are written and might be voiced out, and if you miss-pronounce or miss-recite a spell, it might go extremely wrong…  
3. Both the web and magic share a certain playfulness  
	1. The web is a great place to experiment, mess around, various browser extensions offer ways to customise and play around with websites, such as the one Doriane Timmermans brought to XPUB and which gave birth to the Supervisual Hyperzine<sup>(refer to appendix; image)</sup> last year. It is a huge playground.   
	2. Magic, as I envision it, brings up a certain curiosity, an urge to experiment with it in order to make it ours. It could even be linked back to language for the fact that many fictional magic words sound a bit silly: “hocus pocus”, “open sesame”, “alakazam”, etc. – the [wiki page for Magic word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_word) has a bunch of them.  
  
Now that this is cleared out, let me introduce the core of my research: I intend to seek how, in a hyper-marketable world, ruled by seamlessness, polished Instagram feeds and machine-generated content, how can we fight the rising technofascism and (re)shape the web by embracing the useless, reconnecting to the fun and reclaiming our singularity?  
  
To answer that question, I intend to decipher some layers of the web:   
the web as a craft – to build it, care for it, share it – and its enchanted corners;   
the seamless polished web, ruled by performance and disappearance – mass over individual, loss of identity –;   
the fun web, or how leaning towards the craft is how we fight back against the seamlessness.

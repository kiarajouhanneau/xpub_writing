## 2. The ghost in the shell, a tale about efficiency  
I will dive into the design systems used by big corporations, that in the end define the overall look of websites.   
This part will largely analyse the performance of efficiency that is spreading around the web and how following trends is making our identities disappear.

#### 2.1 Templates and polishing: performance, technicality and productivity   
Taking on graphic design and layout techniques that have been used since the advent of printing, the web relied on template almost as soon as it was born. In its early years, with the arrival of CSS and then Geocities, webmakers expressed their personalities and created atmospheres, using themes on top of templates: as Nolwenn Maudet describes it in her article Design Templates Between Empowerment and Control of Amateur Graphic Designers, templates organise the content’s structure and standardise whereas themes offer a “graphical ambiance” (Maudet, 2025) and the “choices [for a theme] are less about functional graphic design and more about (personal) branding.” (Maudet, 2025)  
Unfortunately though, this didn’t last long as CMSs began to flourish. In a logic of capitalisation and to draw a maximum of people to use their services, CMSs began by mimicking big companies’ layouts.  
> “The growing adoption of CMS contributed to the intensification of “templatization” of pages and their homogenization in a feedback loop where users’ habituation to certain site architectures leads them to prefer that architecture, further reinforcing its adoption and deployment on other sites.” (Maudet, 2025)  
  
With that, over the last two decades, the web has become more and more standardised, to a point where website-building platforms “obliterate the more vernacular aesthetics that can emerge when amateur designers are left to their own devices.” (Maudet, 2025)  
From the globalisation of Instagram aesthetics – polished, flawless photos that depict perfect settings of smooth skins – to the layout of websites – a gridified, aiming for clarity template, induced by the popularisation of WYSIWYG website builders such as wix.com or canva.com – the webspace is drowning more and more into a seamless, polished, personality-lacking visual identity.  
  
I see this phenomenon as driven by a desire for:  
- performance, hence the creation of User Experience (UX) as a way of driving the navigation of a website into a certain direction;  
- productivity, with for example the 3-clicks rule, stating that if a visitor has to use more than 3 clicks to access the content they’re looking for on a website, it is not worth their time;  
- technicality, with the use of shady methods to design websites: frameworks and libraries, JavaScript generated HTML or closed databases.  
The merge of those 3 pillars is Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), moz.com defines it as: “the practice of improving your website's content, structure, and visibility to rank higher on search engines like Google.”[^2], basically meaning it is a set of `<meta>` tags so you have a bigger chance to appear on that so praised first page of search results.  
%% IMG: html meta for seo %%  
This is a fully capitalistic mode of action; big corporations set rules that aim to ensure them money gain, and smaller companies or individuals are left with no other choice than “following the trend”. This makes it very hard for independent artists or beginners to make room for their practice. They remain out of the first page of search results, invisible, shadow-banned[^1] in a way.   
Those implicit rules are set so hard in stone that they have been going on for more than 20 years, enforced by the rules of the website-building platforms. For example, wix.com expects that the template “follows the good practices of of UX/UI design and the trends of its field”[^3].   
  
Since 2020, the web is witnessing a new rise of experimental websites. Neocities, the proud successor to Geocities, is getting more and more popular, Tumblr never really fell down in spite of its numerous dramas, small website builders are also flowering all over the web. The general tiredness towards polished and seamless websites that all look the same, as well as towards the ownership of the webspace put in the hands of a few big tech companies has opened a door to rebellion.  
Unfortunately, that same tiredness has also lead way to the global use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools. Those generators produced images using overly saturated colours, abstract or hyper-realistic shapes that offer a seamingly good alternative to smooth grid/Instagram-like visuals.  
The issue with that is that those tools actually follow the same rules and objectives: performance, productivity and technicality, using shady methods. Besides the disastrous impact GenAI-producing companies have on the environment, the economy and human ethics, they also rely on manipulation and gas-lighting to achieve their goals.  
  
By merging GenAI and WYSIWYG website-makers, we face more and more templates that don’t even need to be edited, as the user will be able to generate their own content through an AI bot. The result of this is what Cory Doctorow calls “the enshittification of the web”:  
> “So what’s enshittification and why did it catch fire? It’s my theory explaining how the internet was colonized by platforms, and why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, and why it matters — and what we can do about it.” (Doctorow, C. (2024) ‘My McLuhan lecture on enshittification’, Medium, 30 January. Available at: https://doctorow.medium.com/my-mcluhan-lecture-on-enshittification-ea343342b9bc (Accessed: 17 February 2026).)  
  
Not only GenAI is perpetuating a toxic environment where a few billionaires can take all our data and communities hostage, it is also stealing and reshaping the whole (western) shared imagination around magic.  
From the beginning, GenAI has been introduced as “magical”. The whole communication/advertising plan of those companies relies on a saturation and over-use of symbols and analogies. In a research paper written collectively by Nolwenn Maudet, Annaëlle Beignon and Thibault Thomas for Limites Numériques, they list the various graphical elements pertaining to magic used by AI programs (the sparkle icon ✨, blue-mauve gradients), but also the mechanics shared by both disciplines: invisibilisation of the processes, grey-areas (as in different companies using the same icon for a multitude of unrelated functionalities). They conclude that analysis by saying:  
> We don't know how should behave something magic : is it normal that it takes time ? Did I do something wrong ? Is its resources consumption justified ? Making the machine invisible through the metaphor of magic changes the relation people have to tools. It is not possible anymore to pay attention to the machine. (Limites Numériques, 2025)  
  
Behind that sparkly and attractive image, GenAI hide all the horrors of their work: slavery and abuse, energy and resource consumption, plagiarism, etc. Therefore, I draw a direct comparison between GenAIs and stage magicians: they pass tricks and optical illusion for magic, but they really are a smokescreen, manipulating minds to believe their technique is actual magic. If any AI program is "magical" it is merely a trick on the mind, making its user (audience) believe something is happening when it actually is a smokescreen. If its "magic" comes from the fact that "we do not quite understand what it does and how" it is because it advertised as making things easier and faster than a human. However, as Dominique Cardon writes, “Algorithms that claim to be predictive are not predictive because they have managed to penetrate people's subjectivity to fathom their desires or aspirations. They are predictive because they constantly assume that our future will be a reproduction of our past.”[^4]  
Yet when dressed up as a magical entity GenAI seems to be looked upon as a good thing, leaving behind any reference to intention, intuition, emotion; in opposition a hand crafted website therefore acts as a counter-spell, by the fact that we can inspect, replicate and adapt its code, thus understanding it, learning and becoming able to recognise and shape our own intentions.

#### 2.2 Losing our identity: paradoxes and automation   
%% → this part is too short!! (add 300 words somehow) %%  
With that grand homogenisation of the web visual land, we face a paradox of wanting to stand out and blending in. We often see people, mainly artists of any field, complaining and struggling. But they might come from any end of the spectrum: those who decided to embrace the flow and the standards blend so much that by looking like anyone else’s their portfolios remain unseen; those who on the contrary decide to go for a very personal portfolio will be so different and crafty that they are not pushed forward by algorithm, remaining in the underground scene or invisible. That paradox makes it harder and harder for artists and creators to make a living and is getting all the more emphasised by GenAIs, as anyone can label themselves artists even if their creations are those of the calculations of a machine.  
   
Besides that paradox, another concept is bringing us to a loss or confusion of our identity and singularity: automation.  
In her article Algorithms vs Interaction Design, Nolwenn Maudet explains that AI designers aim to anticipate our intentions, which would then lead to “automating everything, eliminating all interaction”. This would be very deplorable as the web is all about interaction: servers (computers) interacting with one another, users also, and the whole field of Human-Computer interaction. By removing interaction through the anticipation of intentions, we stop thinking, for all is automated and done before we even think about it. Let’s not forget the brain is a muscle and thinking, reflecting is its exercising…  
Additionally, in her article When we walk away from the lying machines (2026), Margaret Killjoy explains the shift in our collective way of thinking that might be operated by the growing usage of GenAI: the current generation of people believe what they see online is true, we have been taught to believe evidence when we see it with our own eyes. However, more and more content is being machine-generated and fed to us, so our very perception of reality is challenged. She writes: “A child born today will never experience a world in which there is any reason to believe that realistic images, video, or audio represent reality, or that a person wrote the words that they read. Instead of presuming any photo-realistic image (or credible-sounding audio) is real unless proven otherwise, they might simply assume that every image and text was generated by the monstrous lying machines that sit in warehouses just outside our cities and suck up all our water and power.” (Killjoy, 2026)  
Thus, what makes the web human will be gone.   
%%  Short sidenote, not sure to be included:  
Numerous science-fictions pieces continue to explore the notions of cyberpunk and a futuristic era where machines take over. Yet, I have not heard of any exploring what might happen is the web became this place of distrust and fakeness.%%  
Of course, as M. Killjoy also writes, this shift might very well lead us back to embracing more face-to-face interactions, with other human beings, which would be quite positive. But I believe we can also act now, as communities, so that neither the web nor our *in real life* interactions disappear.

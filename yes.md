Words have meaning, and paying attention to these meanings is in my opinion key to a good communication. With oneself as much as with others.  
In that sense, I can expand towards language. Language and words have always fascinated me. Most of my work deals with that, from my first bachelor’s graduation project in 2021 to this day. So very naturally, when I got introduced to web programming languages – HTML and CSS – I fell in love. I view them not as mathematical/logical programming but as actual languages with their own grammar and syntax. Parallel to this passion for languages, I also enjoy games of all kind, so they also made their place in my practice: I mess around, break rules and conventions, intentionally play with the viewer/reader/…’s capacity to get lost or confused, and so on.  
Language and games are both playing big parts in politics and in magic. Language is one of the pillars of politics: how do you address people, diction and tone, choice of words and topics… and convincing, gaining voters. Games share the spotlight, but more insidiously: looking at Johan Huizinga’s *Homo Ludens*, he draws a tight connection between the mechanics of playing and those of contesting: “The agon in Greek life, or the contest anywhere else in the world, bears all the formal characteristics of play, and as to its function belongs almost wholly to the sphere of the festival, which is the playsphere. It is quite impossible to separate the contest as a cultural function from the complex ‘play-festival-rite’.” ([Huizinga, 1964, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/C54R2GCV)). The political sphere has rules, contestants (players), winners, losers, just like a typical card game.  
Looking at magic, what we call traditional magic (spells, potions and big books) lives on through time thanks to language. As for more spiritual, metaphysical kinds of magic (caring, being connected to one’s inner self, etc.), they also involve a great deal of language: we put words on feelings, bear intentions that might be voiced out, it can even involve some kind of prayer. Relating magic to games is a bit trickier (pun intended), but it is easier to connect it to playfulness. Magic has this mystery, this way of appealing to our curiosity that makes us want to play, to experiment with it. Referring again to Huizinga, “just as there is no formal difference between play and ritual, so the ‘consecrated spot’ cannot be formally distinguished from the play-ground. The arena, the card-table, the magic circle, the temple, the stage, the screen, the tennis court, the court of justice, etc., are all in form and function play-grounds, i.e. forbidden spots, isolated, hedged round, hallowed, within which special rules obtain.” ([Huizinga, 1964, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/C54R2GCV)). Here he uses something interesting, connecting magic circles, stages and screens as play-grounds. With such a connection, we end up with an allegory for every theme covered here: magic circles represent magic and physical gatherings; stages are where action takes place, and simultaneously the illusion served by seamlessness; screens represent the web, the digital.   
And the snake is back to eating its tail. The Ouroboros has been invoked. We are now back to the web and the curiosity triggered by magic leads us into its craftiness, through experimentation.

— CHAPTER ABOUT WEB CRAFT —  
see: [Thesis outline 2 (1500 w.) > 1. Incantations and spells (2000)](thesis-outline-2-1500-w.md#1-incantations-and-spells-2000) & [DRAFT v1 > 1. Incantations and spells (2000)](draft-v1.md#1-incantations-and-spells-2000)  
  
From the beginning of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, its inventor, viewed it as a way of connecting all the people of the world together and a great opportunity to expand creativity and imagination (Berners-Lee, T. (2025) This is for everyone. Macmillan, London). This idea took on quite rapidly, with the first net.artists rising as early as 1994 (the web itself was created in 1989 and open to the public in 1993!)  
Net.artists saw the potential of hyperlinks and inter-connectivity to create, the most active practitioner being Olia Lialina. ~~still acting nowadays on the preservation of early web through the One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age[^1] project she leads with Dragan Espenschied, documenting the GeoCities archive. A lot of her work showcase the many possibilities of hyperlinks, notably~~ On artsy.net we can read: “In 1996, her browser-based piece My Boyfriend Came Back From The War made her a notable pioneer of internet art. Her click-to-reveal storyline about reunited lovers was built on HTML frames, a newly-released feature that let developers put multiple pages in one browser. She wasn’t just translating a story onto the internet, she was telling a story in the language of the web browser”[^1]. *Telling a story with the language of the web* – this is beautiful and very à propos as web poetry might/will be mentioned. Later, in 2013, Lialina built *Summer*, a webring working across 26 websites, based on an animated GIF of a woman on a swing. The GIF was split in still images and the webring connects every image to the following by having every website included hosting one image. This ring is particularly interesting for the fact that it plays by itself, it doesn’t need a single click to operate, only network connection and maintenance from the web makers. In 2011, when HTML5 eliminated frame elements, Lialina told Creators’ Kathleen Flood that “Many of my works were based on features that browser developers considered being bugs and were removing those bugs in newer versions, so, I have to find new tricks to keep them alive.” I believe this is a perfect definition of crafting; inflating life into ideas with the means at our disposal, adapt to change to maintain the unexpected, hack – in the sense of using inappropriate or unexpected means to create or perform an action.  
This notion of ‘unexpected’ is also   
  
  
The aesthetics of the early web result from a combination of experimentation, freedom and self-expression. The early web was in motion, full of textures, expanding the crafty practices we knew. **look for something in Kendal Beynon’s work to quote as example**  
  
Crafting makes a lot of sense when speaking of website making for it is a form of expression, and as explained above, an art form. In her book *Reading Writing Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound* (University of Minnesota Press 2014), Lori Emerson refers to crafting as experimentation: “Learning through doing, tinkering, experimentation, trial-and-error is, then, how one comes to have a genuine computer literacy.” This can make one reach the following conclusion: even the most stereotypical developer, having done their curriculum in programming, maths and engineering is making art, in the sense that they are writing, and the trial-and-error, drafting process is very similar.  
  
*The following needs some smooth connection to the part about crafting, a nice little transition:*  
Here again, the floor is shared: magic is also full of crafting. From the most obvious love potion to the most mystical meditation, every practice involves the body (often this of a channelling person, usually the “magic” person (e.g. fortune teller)) and sometimes even some specific gestures to reproduce to reinforce the power of intention.  
Now that this has been laid down, we can dive deeper. Magic and the web share quite some characteristics and practices. As they are both relying on language and craft, the third shared pillar is intention. As stated in the beginning of this article, words bear meaning, making the process of choosing words an ongoing display of intention. What do I want to say, convey, share? The answer to those questions is the resulting intention. That very same intention then gets put into action; this is where we reconnect to crafting, and the web.

We’re always compelled and pushed to find purpose, to have a reason, a use for everything we say and make. That’s the principle of design, art with an applied function. That’s terribly sad. It always made me feel like an outcast, because sometimes it is very nice to do things because we appreciate them or because they ‘feel right’. So let’s embrace the useless, for the sake of fun.  
  
**THESIS OUTLINE – FINAL**  
In a hyper-marketable world, ruled by seamlessness, polished Instagram feeds and machine-generated content, how can we, by embracing the useless, reconnecting to the fun and reclaiming our singularity, fight the rising technofascism and (re)shape the web?   
  
 1. The web, a craft directed to self expression  
	- net.art (Olia Lialina)  
	- Building, sharing, caring (Raphaël Bastide, Doriane Timmermans, Rita Graça, Lucile Haute)  
	- Webrings and digital gardens: where the web becomes *magical* (Daniel Murray & Kendall Beynon, Kristoffer Tjalve, Laurel Schwulst,)  
2. The ghost in the shell, a tale about efficiency   
	- Templates and polishing: performance, technicality and productivity (Peter Molnar, Nolwenn Maudet)  
	- Losing our identity: between fading in the mass and wanting to stand out (Zuckerman, Miriam Suzanne)  
3. Reclaiming: a fight for our future  
	- Fun against totalitarianism (Huizinga, Molly White)  
	- Cyberpunk: aesthetics vs ideology (Asma Mhalla)  
	- Initiatives like wobble, omg.lol. neocities, etc.
